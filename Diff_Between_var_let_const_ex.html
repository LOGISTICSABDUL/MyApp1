 /*Notes
-------
What is the difference between var,let and const keywords?

var:
-----
If we declare a variable with "var" keyword,then immediately we assign(initialize) a value to that variable.

We can Re-initialize(re-assign) the value to the existing variable.

We can redeclare a variable with the existing variable name.

let:
----
If we declare a variable with "let" keyword,then immediately we assign a value to that variable.

We can Re-initialize(re-assign) the value to the existing variable in the same scope.

We can not redeclare a variable with the existing variable name in the same scope.

We can redeclare a variable with the existing variable name in the other scope.

const:
--------
If we declare a variable with "const" keyword,then immediately we assign a value to that variable.

We can not Re-initialize(re-assign) the value to the existing variable in the same and other scope also.

We can not redeclare a variable with the existing variable name in the same scope.

We can redeclare a variable with the existing variable name in the other scope.
